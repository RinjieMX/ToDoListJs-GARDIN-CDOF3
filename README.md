# CDOF3 - TD1

## The project

I chose to do a very simple To Do List. I have two txt files :
- todo.txt : In which the ToDo-items are listed.
- done.txt : In which the completed items are listed.

The console app allows us to do different commands :
- 1 - Display the To Do list
- 2 - Add a new item in the To Do list
- 3 - Delete an item from the To Do List
- 4 - Mark an item as complete (or add an item in the Done list and delete it from the To Do list)
- 5 - Display the Done list.

The console app always works by entering the index of the item or command we want to select.

## Run the project

Importation of fs (modify files) and readline-sync (user interaction).
Clone the project in your computer and run npm i in the terminal.

updates: 
Now the list can be used non-stop
